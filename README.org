3d printed handired keyboard by [[https://github.com/AlfieLockrey/AWLPaul][ALfieLockrey]].
My implementation, instead of [[https://qmk.fm/][QMK]], use [[https://github.com/KMKfw][KMK]] and a raspberry pi pico.
If you end up here please don't use my code (it's for your own sanity), I've made a terrible switch matrix hence the code is a little bit rough.

My phone sucks, I can't take a better picture.
